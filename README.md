#  A clone for that app you have to pay $4 CAD

> *Ever wish you had a ‘quit all apps’ button on macOS?*

Not really... but some guy charged 4 dollars for it and got downvoted into oblivion on Reddit.

As you may have noticed, the icon is absolutely dogshit. The reason behind this is that I don't know how to design icons, and it was put together in 30 minutes in figma and icon composer.

Q&A:

Q: Have you-
A: No, I have not studied colour theory

I don't often end up with 10+ apps open after a work session. Closing them one by one or right clicking Dock icons was not really tedius...

But some guy thought it was really tedius, and charged 4 dollars (Canadian) for it.

So I built Vacuum Clone - a clone of that guy's app but it doesn't cost you 4 dollars.

Why I built it:

Speed: well it's not that much faster than CMD+Q

Focus: Uhhhhhh

Native Design: Well it's using Swift. I'd be concerned if it's not native design.

No Subscriptions: And you don't have to pay

Real Reason: That guy's scamming.
